# Shadowing App (今、話したい)
An app that trains your speaking japanese via Text-To-Speech and Speech Recognition

# Why this project?
###There are two problems I want to solve.

#### 1) It's hard for self-learner to practice speaking
For a self language learner like me it's hard to practice speaking. I read more than 20+ novels, watched a lot of TV shows from Japan. But I cannot communicate or express ideas smoothly.

#### 2) I met a lot of Taiwanese in Tokyo last year. Some of them cannot speak japanese in daily coversation (20%?).
Japan increase the number of working holiday VISA for Taiwanese from 2,000 to 5,000 in 2014. It's good... but it also causes Taiwanese who doesn't have JLPT N4 level abilities applied it and still got the VISA. It's sad for being in Japan for one year but cannot communicate with local people.

# What's the flow
#### 1) Siri say japanese
#### 2) Siri will judge what you repeated is correct or not
